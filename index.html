            From random talks to late night calls,<br>
            From silly jokes to breaking walls,<br>
            We didn’t know where love would be,<br>
            Yet it quietly chose you and me.

        <div class="stanza">
            Through every fight and every tear,<br>
            We somehow always stayed right here,<br>
            The world may change, the days may run,<br>
            But you’ll remain my only one.

        <div class="stanza">
            Years may pass and we may grow,<br>
            Different paths we come to know,<br>
            Still hand in hand we’ll always stay,<br>
            Choosing each other every day.

            And when we’re old and memories shine,<br>
